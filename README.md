# Crypto-Tools
<p>Crypto Tools is a basic Cryptocurrency "swiss army knife" that can gather a plethera of information about crypto coins and wallet information. I plan on making this software more advanced after I submit it for my final grade for my project to keep it open as a usable tool.</p> 

# More about the reason for the tool
This tool was created as my final for my AP Computer Science class. This software was made by myself and with no partners and only uses code I wrote besides the DownStr class and a shit ton of StackOverflow for refrence. 

# NewWallet.java
The API for this section was created by me and hosted on a domain I bought. It was created in Flask, and the API and usage will be open-sourced soon.
