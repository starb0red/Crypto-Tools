# Crypto-Tools
<p>Crypto Tools is a basic Cryptocurrency "swiss army knife" that can gather a plethera of information about crypto coins and wallet information. I plan on making this software more advanced after I submit it for my final grade for my project to keep it open as a useable tool.</p> 

# More about the reason for the tool
This tool was created as my final for my AP Computer Science class. This software was made by myself and with no partners and only uses code I wrote besides the DownStr class.
